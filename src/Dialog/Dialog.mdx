### Developer Notes

#### Accessibility
- When a Dialog is opened, it adds an `aria-hidden="true"` attribute to the root element and its siblings. This prevents screen readers from reading the content behind the Dialog.
If the screen reader needs to read these contents (e.g., for alerts/snackbars), the `aria-hidden` attribute should be removed first.
